## Why Use Strategy Pattern?
âœ… Benefits:
Open/Closed Principle means

You don't have to change existing code to add a new strategy

You just have to add a new class

Algorithm can be changed at runtime

User can change payment method at any time

Code Clean and Maintainable

Each algorithm is in a separate class

Follows Single Responsibility Principle

Testing Easy

Each strategy can be tested separately

Reduced Conditional Statements

Less use of if-else, switch-case

## Key Benefits of This Implementation ##
Open/Closed Principle: Easy to add new payment methods without modifying existing code

Dependency Injection: Properly configured with .NET Core DI

Minimal API: Clean and concise endpoint definitions

Testable: Each strategy can be tested independently
